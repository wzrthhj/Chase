Android Code Challenge: ATM Location Finder
Requirements
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If there are details omitted, it is
because we are happy with a wide variety of solutions. Don&#39;t worry about finding
&quot;the&quot; solution.
1. Create an Android app to serve as a basic ATM/Branch locator. For an
example of how this works, see the next page.
2. When the user opens the app, query the Chase ATM location service. Details
of this service are on the next page.
3. Obtain the device’s GPS coordinates, if available, and pass them to the
service.
4. The service will return a response with a list of locations. Display the list of
ATM/Branch locations with basic information on the screen.
5. When a user taps on a result in the list, display a separate details screen.
6. On the details page, display the name and full set of details for a selected ATM
or branch. The API response is mostly self-explanatory, but you can ignore
any data that doesn&#39;t make sense (like languages).
NOTE: DO NOT create a login page. Only the features in the list above. Feel free to
enhance the UI in any way you see fit. However, make sure the above requirements
are satisfied first.

What is Important
 Proper function – requirements met.
 Well constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code.
 Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
 Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.
What is Less Important
 UI design – generally, design is handled by a dedicated team in our group.
 Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.

API Details
Below are the details needed to construct an ATM/Branch locator application based
on a public JPMC API.
The ATM Locator service can be accessed at the following URL endpoint:
https://m.chase.com/PSRWeb/location/list.action
The pertinent parameters it requires are &quot;lat&quot; and &quot;lng&quot;, and you can easily see its
output by putting something like this in the address bar of a web browser:
https://m.chase.com/PSRWeb/location/list.action?lat=40.147864&amp;lng=-82.990959

Chase UI
For an example of how this service is presented, you can access the feature via the
Chase Mobile App on the Google Play Store:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chase.sig.android
The Login screen with have a link to “ATM &amp; Branch”, which will display the ATM
Locator screen.
